Patrick Kennedy's Final Draft of Project 2 

cientific Question:
Because alternative splicing leads to different isoforms for the human retinoic acid receptor-alpha, could these differing isoform Amino Acid sequences lead to an effect on structural differences between retinoic acid recptor alpha isoform-1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha isoform-2?

Scientific Hypothesis:
If there are differences between human retinoic acid receptor-alpha isoforms in their sequence, then we could be expected to see a difference between their structures.

Background: The gene/protein of interest is human retinoic acid receptor-alpha, and this protein is nuclear receptor which serves to regulate transcription in a ligand-dependent manner. The receptor protein interacts with retinoic acid which is a derivative of Vitamin A. It is important to note that in the absence of its ligand, transcription is repressed. In addition, alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, and will be explored in this project. The two isoforms which will be covered in this project are RARA isoform- 1 and RARA isoform-2. RARA isoform-1 is known to be the canonical sequence, and how RARA isoform-2 differs from this sequence will be explored in this project.

Description of Analyses done: 
The bioinformatic methods that will be used for my Project 2 are pairwise sequence alignment and Structural bioinformatics models. Pairwise sequence alignment will be used in the context of my hypothesis to show the differences in sequences between RAR-a isoforms 1 and 2, and my focus of this alignment will be on the start of the hormone binding region. If there is a significant difference in sequences in this region, then maybe it could be a reason for the difference in mRNA expression regulation between the different isotypes that is found in literature. This method can then be plotted using sequence logos to visualize the data from the alignment. The data used for the pairwise sequence alignment was gathered through Uniprot where the fasta files of the amino acid sequences of both RARA isoform-1 and RARA isoform-2 were obtained.The identifiers for both are RARA isoform-1: P10276-1 RARA isoform-2: P10276-2. 
The next method used was Homology Modeling using SWISS-MODEL to create a model structure of RARA isoform-2 based off of its amino acid sequence. After creation of the homology model, a pdb file was obtained, and the structure was able to be viewed in pymol. In addition, a pdb file of the crystal structure of RARA isoform-1 was able to be obtained from PDB(1dkf). Using these two structure files, their structures were then able to be compared as a movie file in pymol.
